Changes needed to be CL2.0-compliant:
  Get rid of Header.m
  Stop using piclib

Resize images with ImageMagick:
  scale down:
  convert <input.file> -resize 123x -unsharp 0x0.75+0.75+0.008 <output.file>
  scale up:
  convert <input.file> -resize 123x  <output.file>

Use http://site.icu-project.org/ for formatting!
Remove c string legacy stuff from CLForm
Make CLGenericRecord escape string by figuring out what database it uses
Be consistent with naming methods "path" vs "filename"
Make CLAccount validate its own password, not CLManager
make set methods do autorelease not release - ??? Why?
Change "with" to "from" where appropriate in method names
Make objectValue... check if it's ok to access instance variables directly - Check how?
Make page/control smarter about getting owner from filename
make cl_block/cl_marker use value as template if binding is array
make CLForm find fields under "fields" binding, similar to CLArray and "objects"
fix CLForm's copyValuesFrom to deal with selects that have bindings that haven't updated yet
Make magic look for ClassName/key and ClassName_key
Make sure CLImageElement only sends image types that are compatible with the browser
If there's a "get" method but no "set" method, don't blindly set instance variables
There are 3 possible account types:
      Local (/etc/passwd or LDAP), authenticated by the server CL is running on
      External, such as a real database account or account on a foreign server
      Virtual, users managed by a table in the database that CL is using

In the old way of doing "page methods" sender was not always a
control. In the new way I'm always expecting it is. This may or may
not be the "right way."

    Definitely the wrong way. Should probably make a global page variable.

Make short URLs. Trim out as much state as possible. For magic to work, currently require:
     - page filename (string)
     - page owner class (string)
     - page owner state or pk (binary blob)
     - target class (string)
     - target action (string)
     - target state (binary blob)
     - control class (string)

     Session id can be moved to query string and only when cookies disabled.
     Time archived is irrelevant.
     There may be overlap between page filename, owner, and target. When things overlap
     the URL should be as short as possible.

     filename|owner_action=state/target=state/control

Macros for javascript/CSS
    Current workaround is to embed named span tags or hidden inputs
    Cheat for JS to get info from parent <script> tag
      var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName('script');
      var player = scripts[scripts.length-1].getAttribute('player');
