There are 3 possible account types:
      Local, authenticated by the server CL is running on
      External, such as a real database account or account on a foreign server
      Virtual, users managed by a table in the database that CL is using

In the old way of doing "page methods" sender was not always a
control. In the new way I'm always expecting it is. This may or may
not be the "right way."

    Definitely the wrong way. Should probably make a global page variable.

Make short URLs. Trim out as much state as possible. For magic to work, currently require:
     - page filename (string)
     - page owner class (string)
     - page owner state or pk (binary blob)
     - target class (string)
     - target action (string)
     - target state (binary blob)
     - control class (string)

     Session id can be moved to query string and only when cookies disabled.
     Time archived is irrelevant.
     There may be overlap between page filename, owner, and target. When things overlap
     the URL should be as short as possible.

     filename|owner_action=state/target=state/control

Cleanup initialization of CLString classes

Macros for javascript/CSS
    Current workaround is to embed named span tags or hidden inputs
    Cheat for JS to get info from parent <script> tag
      var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName('script');
      var player = scripts[scripts.length-1].getAttribute('player');
